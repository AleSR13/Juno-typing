Juno-MLST7, version $(git tag -l | head -n 1), built with Snakemake
  Usage: bash $0 -i <INPUT_DIR> <parameters>
  N.B. it is designed for Illumina paired-end data only


Input:
  -i, --input [DIR]                 This is the folder containing your input fastq or fasta files.
                                    Only one type (either fastq or fasta) should be present. Default 
                                    is raw_data/
  -o, --output [DIR]                This is the folder containing your output fastq files.
                                    Default is out/ 

  --species                         Provide name of an approved species. The species name should be TWO UNQUOTED words (e.g. Salmonella enterica).
                                    If a --metadata file was provided, the --species name will only be used for samples that are not within the 
                                    metadata file.

  --metadata                        Excel file (.xlsx) containing the information of the samples and their corresponding genus. It should 
                                    contain at least a column called "Sample" containing the sample ID (same name than fastq files but
                                    removing the suffix (_S##_R1|2.fastq.gz or .fasta), another one called "Genus" containing the name of the genus and a 
                                    last one called "Species" containing the name of the species (without the genus). Mind the capital at the 
                                    beginning of each word in the column samples. 

Output (automatically generated):
  out/                              Contains dir contains the results of every step of the pipeline.

  out/log/                          Contains the log files for every step of the pipeline

  out/log/drmaa                     Contains the .out and .err files of every job sent to the grid/cluster.

  out/log/results                   Contains the log files and parameters that the pipeline used for the current run


Parameters:
  -h, --help                        Print this help document.

  -sh, --snakemake-help             Print help document for snakemake.

  --help-genera                     Prints list of accepted genera for this pipeline (based on CheckM list).

  -sh, --snakemake-help             Print the snakemake help document.

  --clean (-y)                      Removes output (-y forces "Yes" on all prompts).
  
  Other snakemake parameters        Any other parameters will be passed to snakemake. Read snakemake help (-sh) to see
